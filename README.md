# LTTS StepIn Mini Project (C Language)

# Introduction

This is a console based Calculator Project in C language. User can perform all the necessary operations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Divison, Getting a factorial of a number, or getting the power of any provided number. The project is rich with clean, information and instructive console statements to help the user if stucked at any point.

# Working

User will have a list of operations, user have to select the operation/operand and after selecting operation/operand, user have to select operators to perform actions on. After getting result, you can quit the program, to quit the project at any moment, press the alphabet E/e.

##### Makefile concept and Multifile Programming concept is used in this project by using custom (user defined header file).

| power          | Input a number and its power to get result |

# SWOT Analysis

Strengths : Simple refined Interface for user. Robust Memory management.

Weakness : Few mathematical operations are not available like Modulus, Percentage etc.

Oppurtunities : Several new functions can be implemented to make it a full Scientific calculator Project.

Threats : Code vulnerabilty.
